          A certain measure of innocence willing to appear naive.
          A certain degree of imagination and a measure of make-believe
          a certain degree of surrender to the forces of light and heat.<br>
          Just one little victory!

        I am made from the dust of the stars
        and the oceans flow in my veins
        Here I hide in the heart of the city
        like a stranger coming out of the rain
        the evening plane rises up from the runway
        over constellations of light
        I look down into a million houses
        and wonder what you’re doing tonight

          <h3>Marathon</h3>
          <p>It’s not how fast you can go,
            the force goes into the flow;
            if you pick up the beat
            you can forget about the heat.
            It’s a test of ultimate will and
            the heartbreak climb uphill,
            got to pick up the pace
            if you want to stay in the race.
            From first to last
            the peak is never passed,
            something always fires the light
            that gets in your eyes.
            One moment’s high
            and glory rolls on by,
            like a streak of lightening
            that flashes and fades
            in the summer sky.</p>

          <h3>Big Money</h3>
          <p>Sometimes building ivory towers
            Sometimes knocking castles down
            Sometimes building you a stairway —
            Lock you underground
            It’s that old-time religion
            it’s the kingdom they would rule
            It’s the fool on television
            Getting paid to play the fool!</p>

          <h3>Territories</h3>
          <p>I see the Middle Kingdom between Heaven and Earth
            like the Chinese call the country of their birth.
            We all figure that our homes are set above
            other people than the ones we know and love
            in every place with a name,
            they play the same territorial game.
            Hiding behind the lines
            sending up warning signs
            the whole wide world:
            An endless universe.
            Yet we keep looking through...</p>
